CRITICAL BUG: Chat auto-scrolls to bottom when Athena responds, forcing user to scroll back up to read the message from the beginning.

CURRENT BROKEN BEHAVIOR:
1. User asks "How's AAPL?"
2. Athena starts responding with a long message
3. Chat immediately scrolls to the BOTTOM of the message
4. User has to scroll back UP to read from the beginning
5. This is a terrible UX - breaks the reading flow

REQUIRED CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
1. User asks "How's AAPL?"
2. Athena starts responding
3. Chat scrolls to show the TOP/BEGINNING of Athena's new message
4. Message appears from top to bottom naturally
5. Chat stays stable while message generates (no jumping around)
6. User can read message naturally from top to bottom
7. User can manually scroll down if they want to see more

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

The issue is likely in the chat scroll behavior. You need to:

1. WHEN NEW MESSAGE STARTS:
```javascript
   // Scroll to show the START of the new message, not the end
   const lastMessage = chatContainer.lastElementChild;
   lastMessage.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' });
```

2. WHILE MESSAGE IS GENERATING:
```javascript
   // Don't auto-scroll during generation
   // Keep the scroll position stable
   // Only scroll if user is already manually at the bottom
   
   const isUserAtBottom = 
     chatContainer.scrollHeight - chatContainer.scrollTop === chatContainer.clientHeight;
   
   if (isUserAtBottom) {
     // User is already at bottom, okay to auto-scroll
     chatContainer.scrollTop = chatContainer.scrollHeight;
   } else {
     // User has scrolled up, don't move their position
     // Let them read at their own pace
   }
```

3. AFTER MESSAGE COMPLETES:
```javascript
   // Don't force scroll
   // User will scroll manually if they want to see more
```

4. EXCEPTION - SHORT MESSAGES:
   If message is very short (less than 3 lines), it's okay to center it or 
   show it fully. But for long messages, always start at the top.

EXAMPLE USER FLOW:
User: "How's AAPL?"
[Chat scrolls smoothly to show TOP of Athena's response]
Athena: "ðŸ“Š AAPL showing solid performance
         
         Current: $178.50 (+1.2% today)
         52-week: $164-$198
         
         ðŸŽ¯ What's driving it:
         â€¢ Strong iPhone 15 demand..."
[User can read naturally from top to bottom]
[If message is long, user scrolls down themselves to continue reading]

PRIORITY: HIGH - This breaks the core chat experience.

Find the scroll behavior in the chat component and fix it so messages 
always start visible at the TOP, not jumping to the BOTTOM.
